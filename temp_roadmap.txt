Phase	Task	Subcomponents	Detailed Explanation	Outcome
Phase 1: Project Setup
1.1	Set up project structure (CLI tool, libraries, tests, documentation)	Project skeleton (source folder, tests folder, docs folder)	Create a modular project structure that supports flexible CLI tools. Set up CLI entry points and separate modules for individual subcomponents.	Modular structure for efficient development, easy CLI access, and separation of concerns between parsing, processing, and output.
1.2	Implement version control (GitHub repository, CI/CD pipeline setup)	GitHub repo, CI/CD tools	Integrate version control with GitHub. Set up automated testing and deployment pipeline for continuous integration and feedback.	Ensures collaborative development, clean commits, and automated testing.
1.3	Define coding standards, documentation policies, and modular principles	Coding standards document, README, contributing guidelines	Create guidelines for code structure, style (e.g., modularity, use of C libraries, naming conventions), and contributions.	Ensures code consistency and ease of collaboration.
Phase 2: WAV File Parsing
2.1	Implement core WAV file parser	WavFileParser.c, WavFileParser.h	Build a fast, lightweight parser for WAV files, focusing on PCM formats, and supporting common bit depths (16-bit, 24-bit, 32-bit float).	Efficient parsing of WAV files with minimal overhead.
2.2	Develop subcomponents for RIFF, fmt, and data chunk parsing	RIFFParser.c, FmtChunkParser.c, DataChunkParser.c	Modular components for parsing each part of the WAV file header. Handle edge cases like corrupted headers and truncated data.	Modular WAV file parsing components for reuse and testing of individual parts.
2.3	Implement error handling and logging system	Error handling library (ErrorLogger.c), log files, CLI error outputs	Graceful error handling for corrupted WAV files or unsupported formats. Logging errors for debugging.	Robust error handling and logs for easy debugging.
2.4	Build unit tests for the WAV parser	Unit tests folder, test WAV files	Create a set of test WAV files (valid, invalid, edge cases) to validate parsing logic. Run tests in CI/CD pipeline.	Validated and reliable WAV parsing with test coverage.
Phase 3: Modular Audio Processing Chain
3.1	Develop modular audio processors (e.g., filters, normalization, effects)	AudioProcessor.c, Filter.c, Normalizer.c, EffectProcessor.c	Create modular components that can handle various audio processing tasks, such as filters, normalization, and effects.	Modular, reusable audio processors for flexible customization.
3.2	Design processing chain structure, supporting piping (e.g., CLI pipelines)	ProcessingChain.c, PipelineManager.c	Build a system that allows users to chain different audio processors together using CLI commands and Unix-style pipes.	Allows users to create complex, customizable audio workflows.
3.3	Implement in-memory processing and piping to avoid file I/O overhead	Shared memory manager (MemoryManager.c), piping module	Use in-memory buffers to avoid the performance hit of writing intermediate files between processing steps. Integrate pipes for chaining processes.	Minimal overhead and maximized speed for real-time or large-scale batch processing.
3.4	Create tests for individual processors and the processing chain	Test suite for AudioProcessor.c, test chaining	Write tests to verify that each processor works individually and can be chained together in different configurations.	Validated and reliable processing chain with tests ensuring modularity and scalability.
Phase 4: Customizability and CLI Tools
4.1	Build customizable CLI interface for managing inputs/outputs and processing chains	CLI manager (CLIManager.c), configuration parser	Create a user-friendly CLI for selecting audio processing chains, defining inputs/outputs, and customizing audio parameters.	Flexible, user-driven CLI for audio workflows.
4.2	Add support for configuration files (e.g., JSON or YAML) to define complex audio processing pipelines
